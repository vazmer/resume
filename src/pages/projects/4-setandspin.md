items:
  - A partner and developer role in a startup which goal was to resolve process flow issues in middle-size companies.
  - Worked in offline hours with a great deal of **enthusiasm and dedication**, maintaining a startup company-like atmosphere as much as possible following agile methods. It failed, yet this has been among the most enjoyable learning experiences for me so far.
  - Written in **React** with the help of Redux for state management.
