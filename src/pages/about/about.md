With over 12 years of experience specialised in both front-end and backend development, bringing a deep expertise in designing and implementing user-centered, innovative web solutions, with a passion for building exceptional user experiences.

In my free time I love walking, listening to podcasts, and skiing during winter when there is enough snow.

Every once in a while I try my luck in delivering a personal idea into reality. A number of failed attempts will not stop me from keep trying.
